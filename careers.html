                  roles in marketing, managing and executive positions. There is a lot that differentiates these roles
                  however they all share a common link in information communication technology. In the following pages

                    <h3>Career aspirations</h3>
                    <p>
                      After spending over a decade working in coal mining and ports as a scaffolder, I was no longer
                      interested in the job as there was no challenge mentally or physically.
                      Over several years I had been buying machinery with the intention of starting my own business
                      and studying computer programming in my spare time. October 2018, I took the plunge and my life
                       has been one hell of an adventure ever since.
                      I have spent many sleepless nights babysitting robots and wondering if I was ever going to make
                      a dollar from this endeavour. As with everything persistence is the key and slowly it is paying
                      dividends.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Career Path</h3>
                    <p>
                      Walt Disney once said, “We don't make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies.”
                      In this same tone I don’t sell my products to make money I sell them to be able to afford to build
                      more robots.
                      My next steps include upgrading an existing machine to be able to process metal and building
                      an automated woodworking lathe. These projects will enable expansion into furniture.
                      The chief aim of my company is to have a large factory full of robotic workers building
                      high end renaissance style furniture and home decor goods. New classics built using ultra-modern techniques.

                    <h3>Educational Requirments</h3>
                    <p>
                      Advancing my education in programming is very important for the future of my business as I am designing
                      robotic machines that do not currently have software packages written for them as they have custom built
                      hardware. I wish to eventually continue my education into data science as being able to use AI to analyse
                      data to help solve problems will likely be way forward for human civilisation. I read quite a bit on game
                      theory and predicting the future based on data and I find it all rather fascinating.

                    <h3>Career aspirations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I’m working in the marketing department of the Australian subsidiary of one of the
                        major German sportscar manufacturers as a Product Manager - New Technologies. This position did
                        not exist two years ago and indicates a change in the automotive industry that will transform
                        companies in the next decade. My main project in the last couple of years was the introduction
                        of in-vehicle connectivity services and the establishment of an online customer portal. Before
                        that, I was a Product and Pricing Manager for all model lines and which allowed me exposure to
                        all facets of the product portfolio while negotiating and outlining strategies to position each
                        model line in the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on this experience and my new role I have the strong intention to drive the company
                        towards a new era, meaning the introduction of further digital products/services as well as
                        online sales models. The localisation of the global strategy to transform the company from a
                        sportscar manufacturer to a premium mobility service provider is my sole motivation as I think
                        that the core brand is able to deliver this successfully. Therefore, a senior position in a new
                        department for digital products and services while overseeing the digital customer journey is
                        what I’m striving for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Career Path</h3>
                        <p>
                            My plan for the next six months is to gain more insights into the digital side of business
                            by completing the "Introduction to IT" course at RMIT and then travelling to the US, Silicon
                            Valley, to work for our digital subsidiary Porsche Digital Inc. In a cross-disciplinary
                            assignment for eight weeks I’m looking for exposure to new concepts and ways to deliver
                            projects that are independent of our physical products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result of this “internship” on a managerial level, I’m planning a vertical step
                            following my return and establish a new department in the company representing the
                            counterpart of Porsche Digital Inc. and the corresponding departments at head office in
                            Germany. With further attention on the topic accompanying the rollout of a new digital as
                            well as physical product mid to late next year, the deman for a new team within the company
                            will arise. Going forward my goal will be to grow and develop this newteam and herewith
                            guiding the company into the new digital era.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Educational Requirments</h3>
                        <p>
                            To obtain the missing skills required I will continue working in my current area which
                            covers digital technologies, app strategies and digital customer sales funnel to get a
                            better understanding of the fundamentals. In addition to that, I will further engage in
                            cross-departmental projects with a strong focus on the Sales/CRM area to further improve my
                            understanding of the sales funnel and digital sales strategies including new digital
                            customer journeys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the technical side my plan is to use this “Introduction to IT” course to get a better
                            understanding of all the different tools available before selecting a course that
                            specialises in areas such as Google/FB Analytics, Search and Website Optimisation and
                            Customer Experience Software as the main three areas. A further interest in an advanced
                            degree in Web Development to gain a deep level understanding of HTML, Adobe Suite and
                            Content Management systems will hopefully round up my profile.

                    <h3>Career aspirations</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my career thus far, and for the organisations I work for, I have focused on where I can help
                        make the most effective changes to software and systems to elicit positive compounding growth.
                        Transformation in companies is very challenging, however as I have slowly become better at
                        instigating and leading change, I have begun working closer with Chief Technology Officer’s,
                        both for the companies I have worked for and their clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through working with CTO’s over time, the role has become increasingly attractive; especially
                        seeing the transformations CTO’s are able to bring to companies, the effect on team performance
                        and morale, and the increasing effectiveness of products and systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is incredibly rewarding work to see people with out-of-date skills, close-minded mentalities,
                        and low morale, have their positions and attitudes slowly turn around. In my own role as a
                        Technical Lead, I have tried to emulate this behaviour by working towards increasing the skills
                        and agility of teams, in turn improving the quality of the software they build, ultimately
                        servicing their clients more effectively.

                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Career Path</h3>
                    <p>
                        From my current position as a Technical Lead, I will require branching out into unfamiliar
                        domains that a CTO is comfortable in. The two main areas I need to focus on is more client
                        facing technical positions, and technical team leadership with direct reports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Client facing technical positions can come from many different postings, currently I am focusing
                        on taking a position with my company’s Client Solutions team. This team is usually known as an
                        Professional Services team within many organisations; however, our Client Solutions team has a
                        larger mandate within our organisation, thus will give me a broad range of new experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If this position does not eventuate, I will be looking to leave my company for a role that gives
                        me these opportunities, either in an Professional Services team as a client facing Technical
                        Lead or in consultancy work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this position I will be looking to take on a senior technical leadership role in a
                        mid-sized firm, such as a Chief Information Officer or head of engineering. This will give me
                        the further managerial experience along with additional organisational context, from here I
                        should be in a good position to take on the role of a Chief Technology Officer.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Educational Requirments</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many of the senior leadership and CTO positions require a tertiary qualification at a minimum. I
                        am filling this requirement gap through my Bachelor of Information Technology. To round out my
                        education and prevent as much unnecessary trial-and-error in my positions, I will continue onto
                        a post-graduate qualification in an appropriate information technology management degree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to formal schooling, I regularly attend meetups, conferences, and training events on
                        topics of delivery, agile organisations, technology, public speaking, and leadership, bringing
                        new ideas, skills, and other’s experiences to my work, teams, and organisations.

                    <p>
                        I have been working in IT Support for most of my professional career and in my 20+ years in
                        the IT industry, I have seen and experienced most of the roles within the support environment.
                        I have been working as a Level 2 Specialist, Server Specialist, Lead Engineer and Manager in
                        the Support and Testing departments just to name a few positions. The companies I have worked
                        for have offered a career path, but I have now decided to be pro-active about future career
                        opportunities. It is for this reason I have commenced my online studies to be able to apply
                        for positions which not only require extensive work experience but also a higher level of
                        education. I would like to find myself filling a position as a Divisional IT Manager within
                        a multi-national company, managing and maintaining IT infrastructure and leading a small team
                        of on-site support staff and engineers, ideally supporting several sites nationally or
                        internationally.

                        and looking after a client’s manufacturing and administration sites in two countries, including
                        the on-site support staff. I was the Technical Lead and Site Focal Point who managed the on-site
                        engineers and I was the first point of contact for escalations and queries regarding the IT
                        support at the various locations. I have thoroughly enjoyed this role and would like to find a
                        similar position that offers more responsibility and challenges. This was a very technical role
                        and did not include managerial responsibilities such as hiring and firing or budget planning.
                        I have also managed a small team of application supporters and testers in Melbourne at an
                        e-commerce company many years ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would say I have the experience in leading a technical support team, including mentoring and
                        training, I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills and I have extensive experience in
                        vendor management and dealing with internal and external stakeholders. These are all key selection
                        criteria usually found in job advertisements for such a role.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I will work on my current skills and I will try to be more involved in the planning of projects at
                        my current job. In a few years, once I have completed my studies, I will then have a proven record
                        of leading and completing projects. It will be hard to obtain further managerial experience in my
                        current position. I will still be able to work on my ability to lead a team in my position as Shift
                        Supervisor and to complete assigned tasks as part of a bigger project.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Educational Requirments</h3>
                    <p>
                        The role of a Divisional IT Manager would require a tertiary qualification such as a bachelor’s
                        degree in IT. This course will take me a step closer to completing my Bachelor of Information
                        Technology which I require to progress not only in my current role but it will also allow me to
                        have a more solid foundation for my ideal job.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>There are major similarities between three of these positions as they are leading roles in management however
                  there is a sharp contrast with Data science as it is a more a hands-on position. The sectors in which these
                  positions are located are all very different however there is a common need for tertiary qualifications for
                  advancement. There is a very minor link between digital sales and data science as digital sales most certainly
                  uses big data in their marketing however the level of understanding required for each is extremely different.</p>

                <p>At their core all of these positions require talented problem solvers and the way in which our team has
                  elected to solve these problems is with information and communications technologies which is why we are pursuing
                  a degrees in this field.</p>
