                        <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

                <p>
                When people are talking about autonomous vehicles these days, the first thing that comes to mind for a lot of people is a self-driving Tesla vehicle on a freeway somewhere in California or in some cases on the side of that freeway burning down with nothing to stop the toxic fire. The biggest issue for self-driving vehicles is the perception of safety of those vehicles in comparison to other vehicles in traffic which are still operated/governed by a human driver. (Plungis, 2019)
                <br>
                In order to understand the topic “autonomous vehicles” and the technology behind we have to examine the 6 different official levels of automated driving according to the international standard J3016 by the SAE and the “Levels or Driving Automation”.
                <br>
                Level 0 - 2 consider the driver as the main operator of the vehicle while Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) support and engage on different levels at different points in time depending on the feature. Level 0 can also be referred to as “no automation”, however the SAE considers even at this level features like auto emergency breaking or blind spot warning systems to be present. (SAE International, 2019)
                <br>
                Level 2 features may control steering and speed of the vehicle via different systems, however, the human driver must remain engaged in all driving tasks and monitor traffic. The most common examples can be found in several vehicles today and include but are not limited to self-parking assistant systems as well as lane keeping assist or traffic jam assist. The latter is a combination of lane centring and adaptive cruise control. (Lim, 2019)
                <br>
                The SAE differentiates level 3-5 from 0-2 by the fact that in vehicles that offer these functionalities “You are not driving when these automated driving features are engaged - even if you are seated in “the driver’s seat”. (SAE International, 2019)
                <br>
                A very prominent example which caused one of the main discussions about safety and autonomous vehicles is the Tesla AutoPilot which is nominally classed as level 3 autonomy. Several incidents have been reported including fatal collisions. (Schmelzer, 2019)
                <br>
                Level 5 is considered fully autonomous and does not even require a steering wheel and accelerator or break pedal. The main distinguishing factor to level 4 is that the vehicle is able to perform the driving task in any condition at any speed. Google’s Waymo project is at the forefront and already offers a small fleet of driverless taxis in California which are considered level 4. (Alford, 2019)
                <br>
                The underlying hardware components to enable driverless vehicles and allow for automated driving are cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, localisation sensors or radars and digital maps which in combination create the input dataset for the the on-board computer in any autonomous vehicle. (Coppola, 2019)
                <br>
                An example of such a dataset for the Waymo project is currently available online with Google also publishing tutorials on GitHub on how to use the data in order to help programmers to build research models. Such datasets, which have also been released by other companies like Lyft, are publicly available and licensed for non-commercial use only. (Alford, 2019)
                <br>
                While autonomous vehicles are seen to be governed by the vehicle itself and are therefore not per se connected to their environment, a different category called CAV (Connected Automated Vehicles) might help autonomous vehicles to achieve mainstream status and close important safety gaps. CAVs add V2X networking and connectivity solutions to the ADAS features that are already existing in those vehicles. V2X (Vehicle to everything) describes different networking solutions and refers to high-bandwidth, low latency and highly reliable communication of vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to device (V2D) and vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) communication. Those solutions will rise in significance in the next 5-10 years with the rollout of 5G networks around the world. (Mueck, 2019)
                <br>
                Lastly, the technology for autonomous vehicles is mostly used in everyday commute situations. However, other applicable scenarios for the application of autonomous vehicle technology are also found in the racing industry. NIO, a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, has showcased what the technology can do in a road legal electric supercar. The following link shows a world record for the fastest self-driving car at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.

                <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The transition to autonomous vehicles will have a significant impact on our transport ecosystem. While there are different theories about the time frame of this transition reaching from 10 to 50 years, there is the consensus that this technology will prevail and make our roads safer and our daily commute more efficient. And the entry into this market can be approached quite differently. While Tesla is introducing gradually more autonomous features in Tesla vehicles, Waymo is already equipping vehicles with Level 5 autonomy but controlling the circumstances (e.g. weather, day or night etc.). Conventional vehicle manufacturers are trying to enter the market place in the form of cooperations and partnerships with software companies. As a result, BMW has partnered with Intel and Mobileye, General Motors with Lyft and FCA with Waymo. The biggest hurdle at this stage seems to be regulations in each individual market. While level 5 autonomy technology might be widely available by 2025, regulatory issues could delay a mass market entry. (Coppola, 2019)<br />
                  Autonomous vehicles will affect a very large group of our society and pose not only a technological change, but an economic, social and cultural change. A successful introduction will allow certain groups in society access to mobility which they have never had before. Children, old people, disabled or sick would have the opportunity to take part in a mobile life again. However, despite the euphoria for autonomous vehicle technology, there are many objections at the same time. People are concerned about the appeal of Motorsport with automated vehicles and question the superiority of autonomous vehicles over an actual race car driver on the track. (Herrmann, 2018)
                  <br>
                  More importantly, people question the safety of autonomous vehicles, in particular in the transition period when driver governed vehicles and driverless cars share our roads together. The expectations of people towards driverless vehicles are a complete disappearance of accidents. However, Tesla already mentioned that the Autopilot will not be able to accomplish that, but it makes crashes less likely to occur and therefore makes the world a safer place for vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists. (Plungis, 2019)
                  <br>
                  The industry is still shaped by a tremendous growth in jobs with US job postings alone climbed 833% from 2015 to 2019. The top 3 companies are Aptiv, Nvidia and SAIC Innovation Centre and represent mostly technology companies. Most wanted skills in those companies are programming skills in C or C++, Python and Linux but also software development, Matlab, machine learning and ADAS. (Mendoza, 2019)
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From a personal perspective this will have quite a significant impact on my life but even more so on my childrens’ lives. In the near future nearly every manufacturer will embark on the autonomous vehicle journey and will try to establish a positioning in this fairly new market. As an employee of an automotive manufacturer I will experience the effects of autonomous vehicles on the industry first hand. While I’m exposed to the technology as such in my professional life it will be the social and cultural change in my personal life that might even be more affected. With autonomous vehicles around the corner the impact on everyday commuters will be quite significant. Not only will it allow a safer travel to any destination it will also free up time for work, leisure or other things while on the commute. It will also bring down the cost of transportation quite significantly up to a point where it might become free of charge. This will impact my everyday travel from A to B but will also reduce shipping cost for purchases or other delivered items. Furthermore, it will introduce the cabin of a vehicle as a completely new living space and the extension of my lounge room for example. Infotainment availability and connectivity services will flourish next to in-vehicle gaming and AR/VR applications that use the motion of the vehicle as an enhancer for user experience.<br />
                  In a latest forecast the autonomous vehicle industry is expected to grow to a total of $556.67 billion in 2026 and will certainly push the transition from ownership to mobility-as-a-service. (Allied Market Research, 2019)
                  <br>
                  This means there are a lot of opportunities in new business areas and with new skill sets required, IT degrees will attract more students than ever before.
                  <br>
                  In the end autonomous vehicles will have a lasting impact on society by revolutionising the way we travel, making transport services more customisable, from door to door and on demand at all times. (Coppola, 2019).

                  Humanity has entered the age of the fourth industrial revolution. Technology once only available to large corporations, are now affordable for the backyard inventers. These computing breakthroughs, combined with open source projects, enable technology enthusiast to create a wide variety of custom systems with small computers at their heart. These small computing devices are growing cheaper and more powerful every day, and have a large community of hardware and software hackers spearheading technological innovation.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The scope of this report will be exploring the world of consumer maker devices and what they can do for us now and in the future.

                  <h3>Arduino</h3>

                  Since the release of the Arduino in 2007, there has been an explosion of popularity and interest in cheap single board computers. Arduino is a family of single board computers with many input output capabilities, with an array of prebuilt add on hardware extensions expanding the I/O capabilities almost infinitely. Despite its ability to be a powerful and flexible computing device, it stops short of being a computer in the traditional sense. Limited to a 16mhz processor, it is not powerful enough to run sophisticated operating systems, however is extremely cheap and versatile for robotics and embedded systems.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The use cases for this technology are vast; from simply turning on a heater when the temperature falls below a set limit, to building a voice activated smart home. An immense array of pre-built add on devices, named hats, expand the device’s capabilities. The only real drawback of these devices is programming knowledge is recommended, but due to the device’s simplicity, a willingness to learn can sometimes be enough. [1]

                  <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
                  When Raspberry Pi hit the small computing scene in 2012, it landed with a bang. A completely functional, single board computer, with fully programmable inputs and outputs. It evolved fast and grew an almost cult following of technology enthusiasts.                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Raspberry PI has become a very powerful single board computer, capable of running a wide variety of sophisticated operating systems. Raspbian is one of the most popular, it is a slightly modified version of the Linux distro Debian.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As with Arduino, there are many add on hats and accessories, coupled with the input capabilities, and multiple programming languages (the most popular being Python), make the Raspberry Pi an extremely flexible device. A dream come true for anyone wanting to build fully functional devices with easy to use graphical user interfaces.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  For non-programmers, Raspberry Pi’s are a great little computer, with lots to offer. The latest, Pi 4, has the option of 4gb of ram, 4k video, and running of larger, more resource intensive software. [2]                  <br>
                  <br>

                <p>
                  <h3>Makey Makey</h3>
                  Makey Makey is an educational electronics toy launched on Kickstarter in 2010, with the final prototype complete in 2012. This device is an add on to the personal computer, allowing for customisable interactions on the PC. These devices allow children to create a vast array of fun electronics out of banana’s, cardboard, family pets, or almost anything, allowing imaginations to run wild exploring the device. This is done by making any object into a programmable button like a keyboard key or mouse click.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  These devices are an excellent starting point to introduce children to electronics, and are a lot of laughs for adults as they learn alongside their children. Children are our future, and the more we can develop young minds, especially in the field of IT, the brighter our future will be. Afterall, if a young Steve Woznick never had hands on experience building circuits, the world would not have Apple computers and devices today. [3]                  <br>

                <p>
                  <h3>World Impact</h3>

                  Cheap available tools enable more people to develop their ideas on tight budgets. Newly emerging technologies as a direct result of these innovations, will evolve the computing landscape in vastly different ways. Right now, and all over the world, backyard engineers are working on varying single board computing projects, including robotics, entertainment systems and gaming platforms, collaborating through online communities such as GitHub and Stack Overflow to evolve their fields. It is an exciting time to be a maker, and from the revolutions built on these devices, the fourth industrial revolution will bring about an amazing age for humankind.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  There will likely be disruption during mass adoption of these cost-effective systems, as companies that have created single board computing devices need to share their market space with the consumer markets. Even within the consumer single board industry, dominant manufactures like Raspberry Pi are having their position challenged by players such as Arduino, ASUS, Intel and BeagleBoard, creating a competitive landscape, ultimately improving innovation and enabling consumers of these technologies.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This explosion in computing devices does have drawbacks. In a rapidly evolving space, obsolescence of single board hardware may be considerable, adding to the thousands of tons of redundant computer hardware needing to be properly recycled each year, or worst still, ending up in landfill. This coupled with planned obsolescence in businesses, a sometimes necessary evil, is a bad deal for the environment. The componentised nature of single board machines means that there is potential for evolving hardware footprints. This may in future broaden the range of corporate offerings to include hardware subscription plans keeping hardware up to date. This would ultimately create reliable revenue streams for manufacturers, reduce the need for consumers to change sockets (often forcing upgrades), and may likely reduce the amount of e-waste generated, or at least integrate the planned recycling of computing hardware into the sales pipeline.                </p>

                <p>
                  <h3>Personal Impact</h3>

                  For myself, the availability of this technology is profound. I have always wanted to build robots, and with single board computers, now have a means to do so without the need to build circuit boards. Within 10m of my desk, I have 2 Raspberry Pi’s; one that is connected to an Arduino based GRBL board that runs a CNC milling machine. The other will eventually serve the same function on another machine. I also have many Arduinos which I have built many projects on, including mobile robots and telemetry sensors. As an owner operator of a business, robotic hands to do the repetitive tasks is a great benefit.

                  I am currently designing a custom-built, Arduino based robot, which will hopefully eliminate all the manual labour from one of my business functions. These devices enable me to operate multiple machines, without the need for unnecessary manual labour, that via automation, add value into my products. Additionally, due to the automation and precision of these devices, requests can be customised and built, with specifications and timing not possible by humans.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I hope to build many of these systems over the course of my lifetime, expanding operations into factories driven via a combination of automation and manual labour, producing desirable products with value.
                  My family and friends are already getting benefits from these systems as they are the first customers for a lot of my new products and are making requests for custom products regularly. Since most of the labour is done by machines the products that would take days to make by skilled wood workers are done precisely in hours.

                  Natural Language Processing or NLP is the processing of the human language by a computer. It is a subfield of computer science and linguistics and goes back as far as 1950 when computers started to make an entrance through the likes of Alan Turing and the Turing Test, he developed to test a machine’s intelligence and its ability to understand and imitate human language. At the same time, scientists have been developing artificial languages to talk and interact with computers for a very long time, simple sets of instructions that a machine can follow and execute. Why can’t we communicate with computers the way we talk to each other? This is where NLP comes in. It is a type of artificial intelligence that aims to understand human language by extracting meaning from it. The first step is for the machine to recognise and interpret human language to then provide an answer or information, imitating human behaviour were appropriate. For example, you may ask your voice assistant, “What’s the time?”. A computer would look at the text and think you would like to know what the actual meaning of time was. Another example would be, “Am I able to catch the tram to the city?”. On the surface this may look like I am asking the voice assistant if I can catch a tram in general. It would not get the real meaning that is, I am interested to know if I have enough time to get to the nearest tram stop to catch the next tram to the city.

                <p>
                  In order to extract meaning from the human language, NLP is using the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. NLP has many forms and applications. We all use it daily without even realising it is there. It starts with spell and grammar checks when writing emails on your PC or autocorrections when texting your friends on your mobile phone. NLP algorithms are also used in spam filters and search engines as well as automated telephony systems (Interactive Voice Response).
                </p>
                <p>
                  An example of voice text messaging, “Siri, please send a message that I am parked outside to Sandra”. Siri understood that I wanted to send a text message and what the contents was, and it found the contact (Sandra) in my address book. NLP was able to gather all this from a single sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  NLP is transforming a lot of businesses and many of them already rely on NLP in the form of automated telephony systems or chatbots (virtual agents). Many companies have chosen to deploy chatbots for their websites to provide customer service and support. Chatbots can run 24/7, 365 days a year. They do not get tired or bored or need a break or holidays. There is no constant turnover of agents and on and off-boarding procedures. The bot will be trained once and that is it. In case the business is growing and expanding, additional virtual agents can easily be added. They never complain about their work and they do not get sick. They analyse the questions asked and find the most suitable solution in no time. Did I mention they can speak multiple languages?
                </p>
                 <p>
                   I used a chatbot a few days ago to reset a password for a website. Initially I could see “typing…” in the chat window. It felt like it was purposely delaying its post to make me feel like I am chatting to a real person. All messages after that, however, popped up within seconds. I did not mind chatting to a bot. It understood my questions perfectly. It checked my personal details and released an email to reset my password. It was really quick. A prompt customer service, I am not used to anymore. Whenever I have to call or chat with my phone and Internet provider, I end up wasting a minimum of 30 minutes just to get some simple information. Often, I am being handed over to different departments and I have to explain the nature of my call over and over again. This is very frustrating at times and does not come closely to the service I got from the chatbot.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   The latest in a long series of developments in NLP is the transformer model. It is a new architecture which improves the way text is analysed and it is what powers Goggle’s BERT framework, a new breakthrough architecture by Google AI. This and other developments in recent times show how this technology is growing at an unprecedented pace. It is almost impossible to say where this technology will be in the next 3 to 5 years. I believe it will continue to be perfected in a way that it will integrate even more with our daily lives. It will handle more and more tasks and advanced versions of chatbots will possibly start replacing people at some stage.
                 </p>
                   <h2>
                     “By 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions will be completely handled by AI, an increase of 400% from 2017.”
                   </h2>
                 <p>
                   Chatbots are making an impact across many industries. End users have successfully adopted them and studies show people generally have no issues messaging with a bot instead of a human. Recent trends also indicate chatbots will be able to match human behaviour making them even more accessible to the wider public. Conversations between humans and machines seem at an all high and it is only going to increase because of it. The biggest impact can be felt in the customer service industry. Chatbots are currently handling simple and repetitive tasks such as resetting passwords or retrieving and updating account information. Machine learning and AI are driving the development of NLP and in the not so distant future, this technology could eliminate the need for customer service departments altogether. As previously mentioned, the chatbot’s qualities cannot be dismissed. Once setup, it can easily be scaled to suit a company’s requirements, slowly phasing out the need for physical office space and human employees.  The people affected by this would be customer service staff who provide email and chat support. However, according to Gartner’s predictions, this will actually take some more time. By 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions will be completely handled by AI, an increase of 400% from 2017,” says Olive Huang, research vice president at Gartner. So, for now chatbots keep adding value to businesses and their customers until it is their time to take over completely.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   This does not affect me or my workplace for now. I can see how NLP could gain access to parts of it though. However, I would welcome it. In my current role as an IT Specialist and Shift Supervisor at a Helpdesk, I have to screen jobs logged by agents for correctness and closing codes. This is a very repetitive and time-consuming task. It is taking time away from me that I could spend otherwise working on projects or escalations that require my full attention. A bot using NLP could help with this. Another area where NLP and chatbots could assist is the resetting of passwords and other similar queries. Rather than calling the Helpdesk and waiting in queue, users could message a chatbot to achieve the same in a shorter amount of time.

                   <h2>
                     “By 2020, the average person will have more conversations with bots than with their spouse.”
                   </h2>
                 <p>
                   I have not been a big fan of voice assistants until recently. This changed after I purchased two network speakers which come with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant pre-installed. I started experimenting with them and I use them for a few things around the house now, mainly to set timers, to play music and the occasional weather and news question. Another area where I use NLP almost on a daily basis is in my car, using CarPlay. The technology that companies like Apple and Google are developing is by far superior to anything car manufacturers can offer at this stage. I guess that is one of the reasons why car manufacturers started integrating them into their entertainment units. Another prediction by Gartner is, “By 2020, the average person will have more conversations with bots than with their spouse.” (Levy, 2019). This is to be seen and I personally doubt this is going happen. Asking a voice assistant about the weather, setting timers and playing music does not come close to the amount of words spoken between spouses in my opinion. Additional occasional conversations with a customer service and support bot will not make a difference I believe.

                       <h1>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h1>
                        <b>What does cybersecurity mean?</b>
                        <br>
                        Cybersecurity is known as the ideology of technologies, processes and practices intended to safeguard several parts of an IT system; parts including networks, devices and programs. Implementing a cybersecurity solution, it is predicted to protect an IT system from data or physical damage, unauthorized access and/or virtual attacks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>What does cybersecurity do?</b>
                        <br>
                        Cybersecurity aids with preventing attacks and other causes of damage to an IT system through the expertise and knowledge of a combination of issues. Matters regarding database, networking, hardware, firewalls and encryption are included in assisting with applying cybersecurity solutions.
                        Through employing and applying this resolution, it allows computer systems to run smoothly, prevent theft of sensitive data and block unwanted intruders from gaining access to that sensitive information.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>What is the latest and greatest/highest level of development?</b>
                        <br>
                        Currently, cybersecurity has a few recent developments aiding to protect IT systems. A few suggestions that can be used within an organisation are the following concepts:
                        Behavioural analytics: designed to monitor and identify suspicious transitions and behaviour. This is founded on the premises of unusual doing, therefore activating the alert system and giving the end user a red flag notification or message.
                        Next generation breach detection: designed to prevent the “zero day” method (known as allowing to establish a position and source information and data from systems or networks for some time without any detection). This can be achieved by combining machine learning and behavioural analytics to detect these breaches or threats and track them to the source.
                        Smart grid technologies: infrastructure that is made to tackle issues and threats through using a range of security standards and measures. This includes the use of Padlock and the Watchdog. The Padlock acts as the gateway that establishes encrypted communication between central systems and the field devices, whereas the Watchdog performs a deep packet inspection for the control system and its LAN amongst other measures as well.
                        Although there are several options to fix physical and virtual damage to information, cybersecurity must evolve continuously to fit the requirements of the organisation or company that has requested for such solutions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>What is like to be able to do be done soon, in the next 3 years?</b>
                        <br>
                        With the continuous evolution of cybersecurity, the next 3 years can greatly advance the way which we could prevent damage of sensitive information and data. This can be done either through applications, programs and firewalls. However, this can only occur with an advancement in our knowledge in certain fields like networking etc. For example, a current cybersecurity application can be altered in 3 years and provide an outstanding outcome that eliminates most cybersecurity issues that we have now and that we would have later. A suggestion for a new and improved application may be able to prevent high skilled hackers to gain unauthorized access into the central system. This could be achieved through implementing a stronger firewall or a designing a specific firewall with unique requirements to meet the organization’s needs. This just depends on the knowledge acquired through the individuals and/or teams, as more knowledge and skills can lead to a greater outcome.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b>
                        <br>
                        Developments that allow cybersecurity to be used as a solution to fend off potential threats are the following factors:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Hardware authentication
                        <br>
                        -	Cloud technology
                        <br>
                        -	Deep learning
                        <br>
                        -	Secure passwords
                        <br>
                        -	Firewalls
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By using at least one of these solutions, organizations can enforce a solution that can help prevent any damages or loss of content within their company.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h1>The impact of cybersecurity</h1>
                        <b>What is the likely impact of cybersecurity?</b>
                        <br>
                        Regarding the concerns of cybersecurity and its likely impact on industries and how it effects today’s society, cybersecurity helps to prevent any major issues with handling their data and information within their company. Commonly, cyber-attacks are one of the main threats to an organisation. It can impact your bottom line (meaning the final total of an account or balance sheet), as well as your businesses’ standing and consumer trust. The outcome of a security breach can affect all three fields; financial, reputational and legal obligations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The economic cost of security breaches like cyber-attacks can often result in substantial financial loss arising from:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        •	Theft of corporate information
                        <br>
                        •	Theft of financial information
                        <br>
                        •	Theft of money
                        <br>
                        •	Disruption to trading and its hours
                        <br>
                        •	Loss of business or contract
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Similarly, customer relationship can be impacted. As customer relationship is essential, cyber-attacks can damage the business’ reputation, and destroy the relationship and/or trust customers have towards the company. The outcome of reputational damage that the business may face includes:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        •	Loss of customers
                        <br>
                        •	Loss of sales
                        <br>
                        •	Reduction in profits
                        <br>
                        •	Relationship between suppliers, investors, partners, and other third parties that are invested in business may also be affected.

                        <br>
                        Lastly, it is your duty to meet the requirements of data protection and privacy laws, the legal consequences of security breaches may result in a legal fine and/or regulatory sanction.

                        <b>What is the potential impact of cybersecurity? What is like to change?</b>
                        <br>
                        Some examples of products or services that are linked with cybersecurity are face ID, thumbprint scanners, home firewalls, digital wallets or cards, self-checkout machines, AI assistants. These solutions help our busy schedule and make it easier to handle life and make things more efficient and make things run smoothly. They also help connect people to services and products required for leisure, work or study etc. For example, myki machines and the google pay version of using your phone to tap on/off makes it easier for individuals to tap on/off at stations when it’s peak hour or when they’re in a rush. This feature allows people to not forget to bring a physical card (myki card) and to be able to view the balance of the card remotely without viewing the balance from a myki card machine/unit.
                        Which people will be most affected and how?
                        People can be affected in both a positive and negative manner. Depending on the circumstances, outcomes and results may vary. But here are some examples of real-life situations that can occur today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Examples of issues that may arise:
                        <br>
                        1. Face ID on Apple products are a great and convenient way to be able to unlock your device with just showing your face and not pushing the screen or lock button to access unlocking your device. However, in saying so, having the face ID option can mean that someone can hold the phone towards your face and be able to unlock your phone. If it is also enabled in other apps, that same person can access personal or sensitive information such as bank accounts or passwords.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. AI assistants can also assist in making life easier and providing great functions in everyday life. However, it can also be a device that may be virtually attacked. Some cases may involve having the AI assistant to control household items by the hackers or, recording what the consumer may request for from the AI etc.
                        Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?
                        Although this development does bring in greater outcomes in a range of ways, it also does eliminate jobs for people as most services are now technology based. Examples are seen when at the local shopping market and they now have self-checkouts instead of human employers. Technology as a broad concept does eliminate jobs however it does also increase the demand for jobs in IT like cybersecurity. With technological advancements, the demand for cybersecurity professionals are increasing and are in a higher demand. However, this may be an issue for the economy of Australia since there is that availability to outsource cybersecurity professionals.

                        <b>How does cybersecurity affect you in your daily life?</b>
                        <br>
                        “Each day before leaving our homes, we protect the property within. By locking our doors, closing our windows, or activating our security systems, we go to great lengths to ensure that our homes have the necessary safeguards in place to thwart potential intruders and those who may try to steal our personal and precious belongings. “, reference this and include at end of this article!
                        Cybersecurity is linked to multiple areas of our daily life routine. Things such as our bank accounts, myki cards, social media, email accounts, personal data, contacts and messages etc. In order to be able to maintain a safe and secure environment for these necessities, there must be a source of cybersecurity solutions being implemented. These applications can be useful and allow consumers to carry out their tasks and activities. However, if there were to be a security threat for one of these applications then it would create a greater damage to the consumer’s daily life. It can result in many things such as:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        •	Loss of data or information can be leaked
                        <br>
                        •	Loss of time/ not being efficient and effective with time due to an application being down
                        <br>
                        •	Theft can occur
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b>
                        <br>
                        Just as cybersecurity and the outstanding threats effect the general public, it can also affect your family members and friends too. For example, the recent security threat for Westpac bank was that it got hacked into and almost 100,000 online Australian users bank details were exposed. This affected some of my family members as they are frequent online bankers. Although they weren’t personally victimized with their information being leaked, they did however lose confidence in Westpac’s online banking. Incidents like these can result in negative reactions from people or teams towards the company.
