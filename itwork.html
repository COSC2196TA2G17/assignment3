                        <p>An interview with Tom Abnett, a tech lead for Iress</p>
                    </div>

                <img src="images/itwork.jpg" class="image featured" alt="" />
                <p>We interviewed Tom Abnett, a Technical Lead at Iress. Iress is a global SaaS provider for the
                    financial services industry, Tom works in their UK region on a product named CommPay.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Tom works in a small team of developers on a product named CommPay. His role it to help the team
                    deliver their software and provide advice and uplift on the technical aspects of the product. This
                    may include leading or advising on technical tasks, improve the technical capabilities of the team
                    and the product, including performance, security, and other non-functional elements of the
                    application.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Iress is a SaaS provider for the financial services industry, CommPay is centred on a subset of this
                    industry in the wealth side, providing solutions for dealer groups to pay advisers based on the
                    commissions they earn.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Lots of communication, offering formal and ad-hoc technical input for other teams, documenting new
                    and existing systems, staying up-to-date with new technologies and their potential implications for
                    the products the company supports, and knowledge sharing with developers and other technical leads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Day to day delivery leads, product owners, developers, test teams and business analysists.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
                </p>
                <p>More infrequently, project managers, other technical leads, senior technical managers, platform
                    teams, and occasional conversations with the CTO.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Very occasionally, communication with clients, centred around providing technical advice to other
                    companyâ€™s IT staff. Occasionally he will provide technical support for complex issues, often dealing
                    with implementations, performance, and security. Tom has no communication with investors.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
                </p>
                <p>The type of work Tom spends most of his time on changes depending on where he is needed. He is
                    sometimes very hands on with the code, at other times, managing working relationships,
                    collaboration, and meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Global communication, Australia and the United Kingdom is on almost completely opposite working hours
                    requiring many late night meetings. Additionally, trying to keep best practices up within the
                    organisation, especially when other teams may not appreciate why we do best practice. Lastly,
                    inertia in a large organisation, it is sometimes hard to get traction on a project when you need to
                    work with many different teams across the globe.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT
                        industry?</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Automating client processes to remove manual labour and enabling customers, having a machine do the
                    work of a human, freeing them to do something else to him best represents IT work.</p>
