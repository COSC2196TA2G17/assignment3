                    <h2>The Gracehoppers Group Reflection</h2>

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lots of things went well for our team in the group project. We all communicated clearly and
                        effectively in our weekly meetings and developed a sound plan for tackling the challenges set in
                        the assignment brief. We each played our part well and completed the work required of us in a
                        timely manner. Checking each other’s work in the testing stage in Jira was of great benefit as
                        spelling and grammar errors were picked up by other members. We were all on the same page with
                        respect to the attitude of let’s get this job done as we all have very busy lives and don’t have
                        time to mess around.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was a bit of a rough start with not all the members being present at the foundation meetings
                        and we had one member that withdrew from the module without notifying the group. If all members
                        had been present from the very beginning the project would have went a lot smoother and the need
                        for duplication in meetings would have been less. Although Jira was great for managing the
                        project a clear-cut plan for who was going to do what from the beginning would have been a more
                        effective approach.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was surprising when analysing the roles that our members were interested in pursuing how
                        different they were. It almost seems as if we should be doing completely different degrees. Our
                        backgrounds are equally as diverse as our desired careers. Because we are such a motley crew of
                        individuals it could have been assumed that there would have been difficulties in forming a
                        functioning team. However, the observed result is quite the contrary to this assumption and
                        after the initial stages of planning how we were going to break up the workload the team began
                        to function rather naturally.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        We all learnt that when working as a group the primary objective in the initial stages is
                        organisation. This was accomplished in team meetings on zoom. Once everyone was organised and
                        knew what part they were going to play in the team the work was carried out in an exceptional
                        manner. Having individuals in the team that have a lot of experience organising large projects
                        was a definite advantage. Setting the stage and pace for our performance was one of the most
                        crucial elements to our teams’ success. Without this organisational framework it would have been
                        a difficult task.

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        At first everything was really overwhelming as I personally had never used Jira or slack,
                        although after a week of using these platforms I could certainly see that they were of benefit
                        and helping us communicate as a team to effectively reach our goal.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        I think a little more training on how to use repositories when doing teamwork would have been
                        good, I personally had one merge nightmare as three of us were working on the same section at
                        the same time. In WordPress files are automatically locked when someone else is working on them
                        and I certainly see the benefit of this.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was surprising how well things came together through using the available technologies, Zoom,
                        Jira and Slack our team was able to communicate effectively and manage a team project without
                        ever needing to be in the same room as your team members. During the 3 weeks of this project I
                        feel that we have worked together as a team rather well. </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        I think my key learning about groups in this exercise is that getting a large amount of work
                        done in a short amount of time is easy with teamwork. When everyone plays their role things go
                        smooth.

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our group, there were many highlights during the completion of this assignment. As a team we
                        were able to communicate efficiently and effectively in regard to the activities/tasks that were
                        required to be completed. The Gracehoppers used many applications to communicate well and plan
                        the project. For example, we held weekly meetings through the application Zoom to update every
                        member on what has been completed,what the next step/phase is and what was is the near future.
                        We also used Jira to plan the project and have subtasks that was required to be completed. Also,
                        we employed Slack to communicate other ideas or update the group on our progress etc.
                        Furthermore, our team kepton top of the workload and made sure to have each team member updated
                        on each task and any alterations that were made. Personally, I was overwhelmed and confused at
                        the start of this project yet with the assistance of my team members I was able to comprehend
                        the requirements of this project.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        As I was inactive in first couple of weeks (due to health reasons), it took a toll onmy team
                        members as they attempted to contact me and get myself on board with the project. In that time
                        being, they had to complete extra tasks on my behalf. Due to this issue, the project didn’t run
                        as smoothly as it could have if I were to be onboard from the start. However, we were able to
                        work on it when I became active in the project. Apart from this, using Jira and GitHub were
                        confusing to use yet my team members were able to assist me in gaining confidence in these
                        applications.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        The surprising element within this assignment was how quickly the project developed and how
                        everyone worked at a different pace. Another surprising element in this group is the difference
                        of each team member and their level in IT knowledge and skill. Each member had features or
                        skills that helped our team in progressing in Assignment 3. For example, some members knew more
                        about how to use Jira than others and were able to assist them with using Jira.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some things I’ve learnt whilst working in this group was how dedicated everyone is to complete
                        this project in an outstanding manner. Also, I’ve learnt that working remotely can be exceling
                        and challenging at times. As we used management tools, working remotely was made easier for our
                        group.

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was quite overwhelmed with this project in the beginning as I have hardly had any IT
                        experience. It was almost intimidating to see that other team members come with quite a
                        different background and were at least familiar with the IT basics. However, I learned so much
                        in the shortest amount of time and the group never made me feel like the amateur of the team.
                        The introduction to tools like Zoom, Slack and Jira in combination with an actual project on
                        GitHub opened my eyes for new ways of planning and executing projects in a digital environment.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was difficult for me to fully understand all commands and functions on GitHub, as there is a
                        lot of information presented.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        The learning curve in this project has been incredibly steep for me and I am thoroughly enjoying
                        this experience and the team work in a completely digital setup. I was not expecting to take
                        away so many learnings, but thanks to our team member Matt Kellock and the introduction to
                        several new project management tools I have familiarised myself with a lot of them and will
                        certainly use them going forward.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        The lesson for me is, that working remotely on a project can be managed successfully by
                        introducing the above mentioned project management tools. Furthermore, it is of utmost
                        importance to communicate as a group in order to achieve the desired project outcome. Regular
                        Zoom video chats accompanied our daily communication via Slack in order to keep all team members
                        engaged. This even allowed us to onboard one team member a couple of weeks into the actual
                        assignment very easily.

                        I could not have asked for a better team, everyone was very supportive and willing to give
                        things a go, especially with my borderline OCD tendency to organise the hell out of something!
                        Most of us picked up the tooling quickly, Slack and Jira was almost preternatural to the team,
                        and where people struggled, we did our best to help each other and be supportive. I had often
                        heard of collaborative university projects being a nightmare, this was the exact opposite, I
                        always enjoyed collaborating with the team.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        So being a data nerd, the stats do not lie, we took a little while to build cadence, I would
                        like to do a retrospective with the team post submission and see how we can work on this for
                        later assignments. I suspect this may be due to problems every new team may experience with
                        initialisation, working out personalities, and finding a working rhythm.

                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was unprepared for how much I enjoyed working with this team, I will be genuinely sad to see
                        the end of the subject! I think the almost daily communication, strong work ethic, and terrible
                        jokes helped. It was good to see working practices we have at my company translate to other
                        environments, I would like to take this team a bit further if they will allow me and introduce
                        retros and pull requests, wish me luck!
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        A cross-functional, collaborative, and supportive team is essential to a successful project, I
                        have worked in great teams like this, and some that are not functional at all. We are proud of
                        our work, and I hope we can build on the progress we have made as a team to further refine the
                        process and make the upcoming assignments even better.

                        The team worked together very well. This can almost go into the unexpected section. We started
                        off as a team of 4 and after a little while found a fifth member who got up to speed very
                        quickly. Everyone in the group felt responsible at all times, working on their tasks and
                        completing the assessment as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        We started off too slowly, not knowing if we wanted another member to join the group or not.
                        Once we had an additional member, we spent another week for her to respond to emails.
                        Eventually, she left the team without having ever been a contributing member.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        The selection of tools we used worked rather well. Luckily, we have had Matt who was able to
                        provide us with access to Slack, Jira and Zoom. We used Slack’s channels for our daily
                        communication and Jira to track all of the tasks from development through to completion.
                        Everyone got used to this way of working so quickly and it was what made us successful as a
                        team. Weekly or even bi-weekly video meetings using Zoom helped in keeping things on track.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        The lesson I have learnt from this is to make quicker decisions and to get the project out of
                        the blocks without necessarily waiting for everyone to be ready. This group work has shown me
                        that it is possible for people to join later and then to catch up.
