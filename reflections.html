                    <h2>The Gracehoppers Group Reflection</h2>

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overall as a team we function quite well everyone has a great work ethic which has allowed
                        us to get through a large volume of work in the time we have available in our busy lives.
                        Having quality project management tools available to us such as Jira and miro has been a
                        great advantage as everyone knew what everyone else was doing which reduced a lot of
                        unnecessary communication overheads and allowed us to focus on our tasks. Our weekly
                        meetings allowed us time to discuss at length any difficulties that we were facing either
                        individually or as a team.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        We had one team member that did not step up and fulfil their responsibilities which reduced
                        our effective overall capacity by twenty percent and increased the workload on the rest of
                        the team significantly. Everyone had a lot going on in their lives and had to make efforts
                        to involve themselves with this project. This is one of the parts of groupwork that can be
                        extremely difficult what do you do with members that are not making efforts. It was decided
                        that we could not continue with a team member that was not performing to even a minimum
                        standard.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our group we have a diverse array of skills and knowledge, during this project individual
                        team members were able to step up and take on parts of the project that they could showcase
                        their abilities in. The effectiveness of this was felt by the entire team as we were able to
                        play to our strengths instead of being forced to work on our weaknesses. This is a primary
                        example of why it can be a great advantage working in a group, everyone brings something
                        different to the table which allows a higher quality of work to be produced in the timeframe
                        available.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        Key take away from this are mainly in the area of project planning and development. As a team
                        we have developed a large body of work on the plans for the Smatra application and it has been
                        quite an achievement. It has become its own entity with a vast amount of information available
                        of what it is what it does and how it will be constructed. The what if game of what it would
                        become with the extra 10 were spent in developing this project is a very interesting game to
                        play.
                        If this project was fully funded with our current team there is no doubt of its success.

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        Working as part of a team with far different backgrounds to myself has been a good exercise
                        for myself. As my working life experience is primarily in mining with a completely different
                        breed of men. This kind of exercise is very constructive to my methods of communications.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m not a fan of Miro and I believe that I made that reasonably clear during the initial
                        project planning phase. I am fundamentally a man of action and prefer to roll up my sleeves
                        and start working on the tasks. I can see that it fostered some good discussions however I
                        feel the project got a little stuck in planning.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        I think the thing I found most surprising about this project is that it has been mostly an
                        enjoyable experience. Although there was a high volume of work to get through with perhaps
                        the exception of myself no one really stressed too much.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        I had to learn to tone myself down a lot over the course of this project as I have mentioned
                        I am used to men who are cavemen with toolbelts, communication is generally loud and aggressive.
                    </p>
                    <h3>GitHub Audit Trail</h3>
                    <p>
                        Almost all the work that I have done on this project was committed to the group website so I
                        would say that my efforts are accurately captured by the audit trail.

                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        The good thing about assignment 3 was for me, that I was able to continue to work with Matt, Michael
                        and Andrew for longer, as I have thoroughly enjoyed the teamwork experience along the way. It gave me the
                        opportunity to learn more about different team communication tools and deep dive into more technical
                        applications like GitHub, which I feel now quite confident in. In the beginning of this course, I was
                        quite overwhelmed by the technical requirements, however, within the group all team members were able
                        to support and help out each other to get a better understanding of several topics. I’m surprised that
                        in such a short amount of time the team has developed incredible dynamics and work ethics and I feel, that we would even be able to see this project through until
                        the end.

                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        The bad is, of course, referring to the group member that has left the project at an early stage into
                        assignment 3. This made a quite comprehensive assignment even more difficult for all of us. This is
                        a challenging project for a group of six in such a short amount of time. However, for a group of four
                        it seemed almost too big. Anyways, it turned out that this event glued the remaining team members
                        even more together and the motivation was tangible in every conference call to still try and
                        accomplish the desired outcome.
 
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        The unexpected for me was to see our team members from all different backgrounds come together in
                        a very short time and align thoughts, skills and work ethics with each other. Among the team members
                        exist quite different profiles with professional backgrounds in different industries. Nevertheless,
                        for the project everybody seemed to just perfectly fit in to the group knowing what to contribute to
                        make a difference for the team.
                    </p>

                        The team built on their collaborative nature, respect, and hardworking attitudes of the past
                        assignment, bringing together a project that we are proud of, despite any hiccups along the way.

                    <p>
                        Reflecting on my personality profile from Assignment 1, where I tend to be controlling of
                        projects, and at times close minded to new ideas, I have become better at listening rather than
                        talking, and relinquishing control to give others a voice.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was a little disappointed that Ceren was not able to commit to finishing the subject, we could
                        have used her help and input, and it did leave us all working harder to complete the assignment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, we struggled to find momentum in the first week, but this was mainly because
                        Assignment 2 took up a vast amount of personal time for the team, and everyone was catching up
                        on their lives post submission.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        React, HTML and CSS came quite naturally to me, I am a back-end developer, so UI skills are not
                        my strong suite. I am looking forward to my UI subject next term!
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        Picking committed team members is vital to the smooth running of a project; Andrew, Matt and
                        Michael have been a dream to work with, both Andrew and Michael are going on to do more of the
                        course, so I’d like to keep up the communication so we can tech review our work and help each
                        other out. I would like to stay in touch with Matt, to see his journey at Porsche unfold and
                        help him out where I can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bringing this lesson through to the enterprise, picking solid team members is essential,
                        commitment and respect should be the foremost principals of any team, something I will carry
                        forward into my work.

                    <h3>GitHub Audit Trail</h3>
                    <p>
                        GitHub and Jira story point totals are probably the most accurate form of work submission;
                        however, they do not tell a full story of the research, revision, or personal sacrifice people
                        put in to completing their work. I think of Matthias who had to balance looking after a newborn
                        whilst his wife was in hospital, Andrew who has his own very busy business to run, and Michael
                        with his varying work hours and commitments. We all had to apply extraordinary levels of effort
                        to commit to this project and complete it with the level of polish it ended up having, kudos to
                        the team!

                    <p>
                        We started off with the same team that already had delivered a fantastic job in the previous
                        assignment. Again, this has been an amazing group experience! I have worked with teams in
                        the past that did not work well together but the Gracehoppers surprised me over and over
                        again with attending meetings, contributing ideas and getting the assignment completed.

                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        We spent a lot of time in the planning phase again. This time, we focused more on
                        brainstorming and collecting thoughts and ideas before going ahead with the project. This is
                        not a bad practice by any means, especially considering the scope of activities but with the
                        tight time schedule and other commitments (full-time work, other University subjects and
                        family) we should have pushed a little harder to get the project started.

                    <h3>The Unexpected</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was surprising to see one of the group members drop off the team completely, right at
                        the start of the project. Having less members in the group, meant more work for the rest of us.
                        This was unexpected and very unfortunate for the team.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project has taught me that studying at University and working together in groups can
                        be a lot of fun. In my professional work life, this has not always been the case. Perhaps it
                        is the educational environment that is less competitive and more relaxing. After all, we have
                        decided to study and do the work required without being forced to do so. This is different at
                        work,
                        where I keep on working with colleagues who do not seem to be happy where they are and with
                        what they are doing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>GitHub Audit Trail</h3>
                    <p>
                        The GitHub audit trail should be a good reflection of our work on the project’s website.
                        There has been a lot of work outside of it that the trail does not capture, e.g. Miro, Jira,
                        Slack and Google Docs. Our commit descriptions have improved compared to assignment 2 and
                        they contain more relevant details this time around.
