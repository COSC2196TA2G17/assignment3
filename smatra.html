                        The World Economic Forum lists five major challenges for big cities of the future on their
                        website.
                        Our project idea addresses three out of the five while it will also have an impact on the
                        remaining
                        two eventually. The challenges identified by the World Economic Forum are Environmental Threats,
                        Resources, Inequality, Technology and Governance. Our project idea is a value proposition that
                        can help
                        big cities transform their transport networks for a sustainable future. (Chee, 2019)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea is to develop a mobile app, combining a loyalty program (like FlyBuys or Velocity) with
                        a mobility planning tool, incentivising the use of public modes of transportation, or the use of
                        toll roads outside of peak hour traffic.
                        The app usage by commuters is seeking to ease traffic congestion around major arteries of
                        Australian
                        capital cities. Therefore, the App requires an integrated approach; tapping into third party
                        applications
                        like Toll Road, Public Transport or Parking Apps to facilitate commuters into desired forms of
                        transportation.
                        The five challenges the World Economic Forum has identified are all based on one underlying
                        trend
                        which is the urbanisation in modern industrialised countries. Urbanisation is defined as an
                        increase
                        in population in cities and towns rather than rural areas. Infrastructure Australia, an
                        independent
                        statutory body for research and advice on infrastructure needs, claims that Australia’s cities
                        are even
                        facing a watershed moment regarding their growth trend and development. Between 2017 and 2046
                        Australia’s
                        population is projected to grow by 11.8 million people. And up to 75% of this increase in
                        population
                        with occur in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. (Infrastructure Australia, 2018)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The opportunities for cities are big but so are the risks. Environmental Threats by a growing
                        number of vehicles on the roads for example.
                        Resources will come under scrutiny and electricity grids might reach their max capacity. Lastly,
                        Technology can help cities adapt, however, to master the right applications can be quite
                        challenging.
                        This is where our project idea comes into play. A technological app solution to manage resources
                        more
                        efficiently in order to avoid environmental threats and educate a new generation of commuters.

                            The motivation for this project stems from personal experience but also from seeing the
                            bigger picture
                            in a world that is facing climate change and its implications all around the world. Cities
                            like
                            Melbourne or Sydney are experiencing incredible population growth numbers and therefore an
                            ever
                            increasing amount of vehicles on major arteries. In a group discussion at the start of this
                            assignment
                            we all realised that being stuck in traffic is a situation we are all too familiar with.
                            Furthermore,
                            we were all realising that with the current transportation network and the increasing number
                            of vehicles
                            on our Australian roads, cities would eventually collapse under the demands of commuters
                            with a catastrophic
                            result for the environment and the living conditions in major urban centres. A solution
                            addressing this
                            situation and allowing subsequent generations to thrive is a challenge, but with one of the
                            major IT trends
                            being “ Advanced Networking” on the backbone of the introduction of 5G technology and new
                            IoT standards as
                            well as the rise of smart cities we think our project is able to succeed. (Deloitte
                            Australia, 2019)

                        <p>
                            As private as well as public modes of transportation on macro or micro level become more
                            interconnected,
                            the only thing we have had to add to the equation was the rewards program in order to
                            incentivise smarter
                            transport choices and therefore educate society. In order to target the daily commuter in
                            the most
                            efficient way, the only realistic option was the development of an app to bring our services
                            together
                            and provide a smarter digital touchpoint. In our view, this project has incredible potential
                            and with
                            the right partners could even be realised in the long run. Future employers would be able to
                            recognise
                            the complexity of the project and realise that only with precise planning, open
                            communication and the
                            right IT skill sets combined in our team this endeavour is manageable. In the end, this
                            project might
                            even attract one of the major 5G network companies to assist in order to gain public
                            reputation as a
                            sustainable and innovative market player.

                                The market in which our app is positioned is a subset of different segments that are
                                already
                                existing in, in some instances, quite matured markets. The first segment are
                                ride-hailing platforms
                                like Uber and Lift, which have already established a rather large customer base.
                                Companies that
                                offer transport services also include public transport alternatives like Myki for
                                example or can
                                relate to Micro transportation or the so-called last mile service like Lime scooters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A second segment that has to be monitored is the MaaS area, however, at this stage only
                                small
                                initiatives have developed. As an example, the RACV has launched the multi-modal
                                transportation
                                platform Arevo, but is yet to confirm results as to the uptake of the service. For MaaS,
                                current
                                research projects suggest that it is still undecided who is able to offer a fully
                                integrated
                                transportation platform. Governments as well as private companies are still holding back
                                due to
                                the complexity of the topic. The MaaS segment is likely to be the closest to our
                                anticipated
                                service offering and in the graphic below we indicated our USP vs. other MaaS offerings.
                                The
                                integration of a rewards program is a first within this industry. (ITS Australia, 2018)

                            <p>
                                Following MaaS, the third potential competitors segment for our App is the customer
                                loyalty
                                segment with established programs like FlyBuys, Velocity or Qantas. This segment is new
                                to the
                                initiatives in the smart mobility sector, however it could revolutionise the uptake and
                                education
                                of modern commuters by incentivising different trip options. The fourth segment is the
                                automotive
                                sector and also road toll companies as they enable the private and self-controlled
                                transport as
                                well as have access to important traffic management data. Lastly, the big technology
                                companies
                                like Google and Apple with their map applications offer today’s transport intelligence
                                for the
                                largest group of users via in-vehicle systems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To conclude, there are several market segments that offer similar services and
                                competitors can
                                arise in either of them. However, the USP with the integration of a rewards program to
                                educate
                                daily commuters to change there habits is what sets our app apart from all other
                                alternatives.
                                A partnership with e.g. the RACV and their multi-modal platform for mobility as a
                                service may
                                be considered. In order to get a better understanding of our app service solution
                                including our
                                USP, we have also identified different strength and weaknesses in a detailed SWOT
                                Analysis which
                                is presented below.

                            <p>Transport is Australia’s third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, with
                                emissions from transport increasing nearly 60% since 1990, more than any other
                                sector. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
                            <p>According to a recent update, published by the Australian Government, Australia
                                produced 535.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e) emissions,
                                almost a fifth of these emissions are caused by transport (17%). Cars are
                                responsible for roughly half of all transport emissions. <sup>[2]</sup> Car
                                emissions have grown by 25% since 1990. <sup>[3]</sup></p>
                            <p>To reduce these climate polluting emissions, we promote greener commuting through
                                public transport, Linkt and electric cars.</p>
                            <p><em><strong>Thus, our project’s aim is to create an application that helps slow down
                                        Global Warming by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases through car
                                        emissions.</strong></em>

                            <p>Our aim inspired many robust discussions amongst the group, and from these conversations
                                we generated a list of goals that would drive our aim. These initial goals were
                                seemingly disparate at first, however, as we refined our vision, we were able to cluster
                                these goals into three main objectives driving the initial stages of the project, these
                                include:</p>
                            <p><em><strong>To create attention for the Smatra programme and its app, establish a brand
                                        strategy</strong></em></p>
                            <p>For Smartra to be a success, it needs a clearly identifiable brand, messaging, role, and
                                media presence. From this work, we need to identify the most appropriate target markets,
                                prove out potential market messaging, including; product, advertising, positioning,
                                value propositions, etc. This will help ensure our user base is engaged and growing,
                                that we can continually drive our app usage, and eventually transition from completely
                                artificial growth to a natural growth of our user base.</p>
                            <p><em><strong>To establish an attractive rewards programme that promotes the usage of
                                        transport alternatives, build partnerships with transport and rewards vendors
                                    </strong></em></p>
                            <p>Our programme will require partnerships with third-party vendors, both in transport and
                                rewards programme spaces. Transportation partnerships will be required to track trips on
                                transportation alternatives, encouraging trips at reduced congestion times across
                                varying forms of transport.</p>

                            <p>From trips taken, end users will acquire points. Partnerships will be required with
                                points programme vendors to convert our points to theirs, allowing our end users to
                                enjoy rewards from their trips.</p>
                            <p><em><strong>Build an app that provides value, with clear journeys through the
                                        application, ultimately driving its use</strong></em></p>
                            <p>We require an application that is easy to use, encourages trips at less congested times,
                                and guides the user through the process of trips, to points, to rewards efficiently.
                                This application will need to be secure, reliable, and beneficial to the end user,
                                encouraging its reuse and end user advocacy.</p>

                            <p>To successfully test Smatra, we need to define quantifiable measures against our projects
                                goals to measure our success. Below is a list of our goals and how we intend to test
                                them in a quantifiable way:

                                    <h2>Risks</h2>

                            <p>
                              During the planning of SMATRA we identified a number of risks with the project our
                              aim with the this is to be able to effectively manage and or mitigate these issues
                              so as they do not cause any long-term ill effects to the project. With software
                              development projects in general there are five key areas of impact, we have divided
                              our identified risks into the following areas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>New technologies</strong><br>
                              There is significant risk of not currently having the skill sets available within the existing team to fully develop and deploy the Smartra application. Training and upskilling on latest developments in networking and mobile phone technology will require time, onboarding skilled experts or advisors in areas to fill skill gaps may be required.
                              <br>
                              <strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
                              Charting the skills that are required for project completion and mapping our team’s skills against this chart will help us to identify any skill gaps that will need to be filled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>User and functional requirements</strong><br>
                              There is a substantial risk of scope creep and the need for extensive refactoring during the project due to poor planning of the application requirements.
                              <br>
                              <strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
                              Before beginning the programming of the SMARTRA application we need a clear and concise plan of what features will be available to the end user. A top down programming approach will deliver a structure and allow us to mitigate the need for extensive refactoring during the development lifecycle. Properly structuring the program from the beginning will make the inclusion of new features a lot less painful when the need for them is discovered during development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Application and system architecture</strong><br>
                              The wrong choice of platform for the development of the application could become a critical problem in the later phases if the architecture requirements are not supported in the framework chosen by the team.
                              <br>
                              <strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
                              A detailed analysis of the architecture requirements for the application either by the current team or this work could be outsourced to a skilled software engineer to analyse the applications architectural requirements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Performance</strong><br>
                              There is a chance that the application will not meet the expectations of our internal and external customers. In adequate testing in the development lifecycle may result in the development of a buggy sub-standard application that falls well short of expectations.
                              <br>
                              <strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
                              A clear benchmark for the requirements of the application and well defined and documented testing procedures will need to be developed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Organizational</strong><br>
                              Not having a well-structured team with clearly defined goals is a danger to any project, members that are not focused on the delivery of a world class product can affect the entire team and degrade the overall project outcomes.
                              <br>
                              <strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
                              In the early stages of the project it may be worthwhile to do some team building exercises to help solidify the team. Weekly discussions on not just how the work is going but how the team members are handling as many factors outside of work can affect human performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                              Our aim is not to avoid risks completely with this project as all software development endeavours are inherently risky. Our aim is to understand the risks and find ways to manage them reducing their potential to have a damaging impact on the project

                                Meetings have moved from one long Monday night meeting to shorter, more frequent
                                meetings, and due to the correspondence over Slack between Zoom sessions, allowed
                                for much more constructive professional conversations when a Zoom session was
                                hosted. More frequent meetings meant that there were more opportunities for those
                                who missed our Monday night meetings to join another night, and if a team member
                                missed a session, they were able to catch the minutes on Slack later. Over time,
                                especially if the project was to become commercial, the team would likely benefit
                                from adopting Agile development practices; where daily stand-ups, retrospectives and
                                kick-offs provide structure to this frequent level of communication.
