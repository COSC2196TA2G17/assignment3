                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Our project is based on Matthias Prilipp’s project idea for Assignment 1, we agreed it provided a
                    good combination of public usefulness with technical challenges.</p>
                <p>The idea is to develop a mobile app, combining a loyalty program (like FlyBuys or Velocity) with a
                    mobility tool, incentivising the use of public modes of transportation, or the use of toll roads
                    outside of peak hour traffic.</p>
                <p>The app function is to ease traffic congestion around major arteries of Australian capital cities.
                    The App requires an integrated approach; tapping into third party applications like Toll Road,
                    Public Transport or Parking Apps to facilitate commuters into desired forms of transportation.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Due to ever crowded cities, maintaining liveable conditions will require city ecosystems to change
                    dramatically. Inefficient and old transportation networks, as well as an increasing number of
                    vehicles emitting CO2 posing a health risk, will have major implications on cities around Australia,
                    a pertinent issue for its citizens. </p>
                <p>“Traffic congestion is one of the most significant challenges facing our cities. Melbourne’s
                    population is growing by around 325 people a day and is projected to overtake Sydney’s within a
                    decade. Identified as the most congested city in the country, this was a factor in Melbourne losing
                    its seven-year grip on the “world’s most liveable city” title last year.” (Misha Ketchell 2019)</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                </p>
                <img src="images/Smatra.png" class="image right" />
                <p>The App is called SMATRA (SMArt TRAffic). The overall goal of the App is to make travel around the
                    city smarter by gamifying the experience of the everyday commute. Travelers and/or commuters can
                    accumulate points by using different modes of transportation. As an example, if the customer links
                    his/her Linkt account to the App the App detects when the commute occurred. If the event happened
                    outside of the peak period (6:00 – 9:30 AM) the customer will accumulate points. If no commute is
                    detected on traffic heavy days, due to the customer avoiding toll roads or leaving the vehicle at
                    home, booster points will increase the points balance significantly.</p>
                <p>The points balance allows the customer to achieve different membership statuses like silver, gold, or
                    platinum, giving them access to further benefits. Some of these benefits may include access to fast
                    traffic lanes, premium carparks at public events, or free train/tram access for a period. The App
                    would follow a very similar structure to already existing loyalty program Apps, with a navigation
                    bar at the bottom, and the current points status at the top.</p>
                <p>The navigation at the bottom menu consists of Home, Activity, My Account, and Settings.</p>
                <img src="images/smatramock.png" class="image leftlarge" />
                <p>The “Home” menu gives the customer an overview of the current point status, membership status,
                    programs currently enlisted in (e.g. Linkt account for toll roads, or Myki for public transport) and
                    which special offer the user currently has activated (e.g. use of toll roads outside of peak hour
                    for 1 month).</p>
                <p>The “Activity” menu lists the user’s activities for the different modes of transportation. If not
                    automatically captured by linked accounts, the customer has the option to scan receipts as proof of
                    activity or to reclaim points. The list view shows the transport mode, the transaction date, amounts
                    spent and the points that have been awarded.</p>
                <p>The “My Account” menu features the account details of the user, and allows the user to edit personal
                    information, such as contact methods, registered vehicles, or transport accounts that qualify and
                    link to the app. It also gives the user the option to transfer points to other loyalty programs,
                    users or receive cash payouts.</p>
                <p>Under “Settings” the user can adjust their preferences, such as privacy, notifications, and
                    authentication. It also allows the user to log out of the app, and gives the customer access to
                    FAQ’s, and a support hotline. Lastly, the user can access the app’s terms of use and privacy policy,
                    informing the user on their rights, obligations and how their data will be collected and used.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                </p>
                <p>To develop the SMATRA application, various tools and technologies will need to be employed. The
                    development team will require a PC or Mac capable of running an IDE that supports iOS and Android
                    development, an IDE that supports backend code development (e.g. Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ or
                    PyCharm) and an IDE that supports iOS and Android development (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Reactide,
                    etc.).</p>
                <p>The development team will also need technologies to build their applications with, these may include
                    programming frameworks and languages capable of running on iOS and Android (e.g. Xamarin and .Net
                    Core, React Native and JavaScript, etc.), programming frameworks and languages capable of running on
                    serverless compute (e.g. .Net Core, Java, Node.JS, etc.), and database technologies to store and
                    retrieve user data and compile analytics (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, the development team will require platforms to develop upon, including a serverless cloud
                    compute capable hosting provider such as AWS, Azure or GCP, a platform to host source code (e.g.
                    GitHub, GitLab or AWS CodeCommit), and a continuous deployment platform (e.g. Jenkins, BuildKite or
                    Bamboo).</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                </p>
                <p>This application is built around data from 3rd parties, thus API’s between companies such as Linkt,
                    Myki, Opal and our backend systems will drive its functionality. Strong strategic alliances to build
                    buy-in, and drive innovative working relationships with transportation partners will determine the
                    success of the app. </p>
                <p>Additionally, the app will require strong adoption from the general public, thus the project will
                    require experienced marketing know-how to ensure it is visible on platforms such as Google’s and
                    Facebook’s advertising networks and is prominent in its app’s platform stores.</p>
                <p>More technically, the app will require a team with knowledge of building mobile applications,
                    including but not limited to iOS and Android development experience, experience in languages that
                    support development for both platforms (Xamarin, React Native, etc.), SSO including OAUTH 2.0 and
                    OIDC, and secrets management on mobile devices.</p>
                <p>This app will also require strong, cloud-first development experience, including but not limited to
                    full-stack AWS development, experience in loosely-coupled API driven applications, generating and
                    consuming API’s in a secure manor, CICD pipelines, networking and security of cloud VPC’s,
                    auto-scalability of services and infrastructure, SSO including OAUTH 2.0 and OIDC, and metrics,
                    logging and tracing of loosely coupled applications.</p>
                <p>Below is a basic architectural diagram, highlighting some of the backend services required to build
                    this application:</p>
                <p><img src="images/architecture.svg" class="image fit" alt="Architectual diagram" /></p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                </p>
                <p>By relieving the pressure on our current traffic network, and shifting demand away from peak travel
                    times, traffic congestion will undoubtedly ease, and with the right team, corporate and government
                    support, this app could help change one of the biggest issues facing society, whilst making cities
                    much more liveable.</p>
                <p>Longer term adoption may have ancillary effects of educating younger generations on smarter mobility,
                    encouraging greener forms of transport, and potentially lead to a change towards a more flexible
                    work/life balance.</p>
